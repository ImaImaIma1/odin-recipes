      <li>six whole eggs</li>
      <li>six egg yolks</li>

      <li>Step 1: Grease and flour baking pan</li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Beat butter in bowl until smooth and add sugar. Stir until
        creamy and light texture.

      <li>
        Step 3: In a separate bowl, combine eggs, egg yolks, vanilla, and salt.
        Slowly drizzle egg mixture into your butter mixture with mixer on low
        speed. Pause to scrape sides and bottom of the bowl, then increase speed
        and beat for another 1-2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Reduce speed to low and gradually add flour. Scrape and stir
        again on medium speed until well-combined, then beat for another minute.
        You should have a completely smooth, uniform batter. Pour batter into
        prepared pan, smoothing the top.

      <li>
        Step 5: Bake in 350F oven for an hour and ten to an hour and fifteen
        minutes. Test with a wooden skewer for doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 6: Cool for 20 minutes, then run a knife around the sides and
        center of the pan before carefully inverting onto a cooling rack. Allow
        to cool completely before serving.
